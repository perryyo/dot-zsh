# zsh

My ZSH dotfiles.


## Why ZSH?

ZSH is a great shell. Coming from bash, it provides you with the same basic
functionality, as well as lots of additional goodies:

- Better tab completion.
- History that is shared across all terminal sessions.
- Lots of great third party apps.


## Install

To install these dotfiles, you can run the commands below. As with all my
dotfiles, I'll assume you're installing them into your `~/.dotfiles` directory.
